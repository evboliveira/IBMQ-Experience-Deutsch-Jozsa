# IBMQ-Experience-Deutsch-Jozsa
Repository for the QASM code of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm implemented on IBMQ Experience. In the code ther is the implementation os the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for both a constant and a balanced functions of 8 entries. It was used one quantum register of 3 qbits to represent the entries, one quantum register to represent the values of the binarie functions, and on classsical register of 3 bits.

The discutions on the implementation of this algorithm and its implications can be found in our [arxiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07910).
